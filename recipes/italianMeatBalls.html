        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <strong>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet 
                with parchment paper or a baking mat.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, add Italian bread crumbs and milk. Combine well and set aside while preparing the other ingredients, 
                for at least 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add ground beef, onion, garlic, egg, salt, black pepper, parmesan cheese, and parsley to the breadcrumb mixture, 
                and mix with your hands until just combined. Do not overmix.</li>
            <li>Portion onto the prepared baking sheet (using a cookie or ice cream scoop will make it easier). 
                Wet your hands with water, and roll meatballs into 2" diameter balls.</li>
            <li>Bake for about 18-20 minutes, or until the meatballs have reached an internal temperature of 165˚F (74°C). 
                Remove from oven and drain off any excess fat. Serve with your favorite sauce and enjoy!</li>
